# Blocking Gambling Sites in the Philippines

## Overview

This document outlines the steps and considerations for blocking access to gambling sites in the Philippines. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide for organizations, internet service providers (ISPs), and individuals looking to restrict access to online gambling platforms.

Protecting minors from accessing gambling sites is crucial for their safety and well-being. Parents and guardians play a vital role by monitoring internet usage and educating children about the risks associated with gambling and create a safer environment, ensuring that young individuals are shielded from potential harm and the negative consequences of gambling.
